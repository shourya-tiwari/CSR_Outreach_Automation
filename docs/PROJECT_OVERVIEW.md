# CSR Lead Generation Platform — Project Overview

> Merged from `PROJECT_OVERVIEW_V1.md` (Simple Project Roadmap) and
> `PROJECT_OVERVIEW_V2.md` (MVP+ Roadmap). This is the combined, canonical
> description of what the product is meant to do. See the note on
> **actual implementation** at the bottom for how the shipped code
> currently differs from this plan.

## Project Goal

Build a simple web application that helps NGO staff:

- Find companies suitable for CSR outreach
- Identify relevant CSR decision-makers
- Save useful contact information
- Prioritize the best leads
- Generate personalized outreach emails
- Track communication and follow-ups

The application should be easy enough for non-technical users to operate
without training. It should feel closer to a simple CRM than a technical
analytics platform.

## Core Features (MVP)

### 1. Company Search

Allow NGO staff to quickly find companies that may be suitable for CSR
partnerships.

**Search filters** (simple): Company Name, Industry, State, City, CSR
Focus Area, CSR Spending Range.
**Optional filters:** Revenue, Employee Count.

**Each result displays:** Company Name, Industry, Location, Website, CSR
Focus, CSR Spending (if available), Lead Score, View Details button.

**Data sources:** company websites, CSR reports, MCA/public company data,
NSE/BSE company information, publicly available corporate reports.

**Flow:** select filters → click Search → view matching companies → open
a company → save it as a lead.

### 2. CSR Decision Maker Finder

Help NGO staff identify the right person to contact inside a company.

**Target roles:** CSR Head, Sustainability Head, Foundation Director, HR
Head, Corporate Communications Head.

**Information shown (when available):** Person Name, Designation,
Company, Official Work Email, Company Phone Number, LinkedIn Profile,
Source Link.

**Public sources:** company CSR pages, leadership pages, annual reports,
sustainability reports, press releases, public professional profiles.

**Important rule:** only save publicly available professional
information. Do not collect private phone numbers, personal email
addresses, or hidden/restricted information.

**Flow:** open a company → click "Find CSR Contacts" → system displays
the best publicly available contacts.

### 3. Contact Database

One simple place for the NGO to manage all company and contact
information.

- **Company:** Name, Industry, City, State, Website, CSR Focus
- **Contact:** Name, Designation, Official Email, Company Phone,
  LinkedIn, Source URL
- **Outreach info:** Last Contacted Date, Current Status, Follow-up Date,
  Notes

**Actions:** add / edit / delete / search contact, add notes, export
contacts to CSV.

**Layout:** avoid complex tables — keep it simple: Company → Contact →
Status → Notes.

### 4. AI Lead Scoring

Help NGO staff understand which companies should be contacted first,
with no configuration required from the user — the score appears
automatically on every company profile.

**Factors:** match with NGO focus area, company CSR spending, company
location, previous CSR activities, company size.

**Output:** a simple score (e.g. "Lead Score: 87/100") plus a short
explanation (e.g. strong match with NGO focus, active CSR programs,
relevant geographic presence, good CSR spending).

**Priority labels:** High / Medium / Low Priority.

### 5. AI Email Generator

Help NGO staff create professional CSR outreach emails quickly.

**Inputs (auto-filled):** NGO Name, NGO Work Area, Company Name, Contact
Name, Contact Designation, Company's CSR Focus.

**Email types:** First Outreach, Follow-up, Meeting Request, Thank You.

**Output:** Subject Line + personalized email body.

**Actions:** Generate Email, Regenerate, Copy Email; optionally edit
before copying.

**Important rule:** the system generates draft emails only — NGO staff
must review before sending.

### 6. Outreach Dashboard

A simple overview of all CSR outreach activity.

**Headline numbers:** Total Companies, Companies Contacted, Replies
Received, Meetings Scheduled, Proposals Sent, Successful Partnerships.

**Lead status stages:** New → Contacted → Follow-up → Meeting → Proposal
Sent → Successful / Not Interested.

**Follow-up section:** Company, Contact Person, Follow-up Date, Status —
with overdue follow-ups highlighted.

**Recent activity feed:** email drafted, contact updated, follow-up
completed, meeting scheduled, proposal sent.

## Recommended Technical Approach (planning docs)

Keep the infrastructure as simple as possible.

| Layer     | Choice                                   |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------|
| Frontend  | React + Tailwind CSS                      |
| Backend   | FastAPI                                   |
| Database  | PostgreSQL                                |
| AI        | Gemini API or OpenAI API                  |
| Hosting   | Vercel (frontend), Render/Railway (backend), Neon/Supabase (Postgres) |

Avoid unnecessary infrastructure: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines,
microservices, complex cloud architecture, authentication complexity
beyond what's needed. Priority is reliability and ease of use over
infrastructure complexity.

## Design Principle

Every major action should require as few clicks as possible.

**Prefer:** clear buttons, simple language, large search boxes, dropdown
filters, automatic AI results, minimal forms, mobile-friendly pages.

**Avoid:** technical terminology, complicated settings, too many
dashboards, large forms, hidden features, unnecessary configuration.

## Note on Actual Implementation (as of 2026-09-25)

The product targets a specific NGO ("A Ray of Hope Foundation", based in
Pune) rather than a generic multi-NGO platform. The **active**
implementation now follows the plan's recommended stack literally:

| Layer     | Choice                                   |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------|
| Frontend  | React + Tailwind (Vite) — `frontend/`      |
| Backend   | FastAPI — `backend/app/`                   |
| Database  | PostgreSQL (SQLAlchemy) — `backend/app/models.py` |

Phase 1 (core application: company search, profile page, contact
database, notes/status tracking) is complete on this stack — see
[`TASKS.md`](TASKS.md) for verification details and
[`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) for what's next.

An earlier prototype (Streamlit + SQLite, plus a CSR-1/80G/12A
compliance engine not in either original overview doc) lives in
[`legacy-streamlit-prototype/`](../legacy-streamlit-prototype/) for
reference. **It is superseded and does not count toward any phase's
completion** — all current and future phase work targets `backend/` and
`frontend/` only.
